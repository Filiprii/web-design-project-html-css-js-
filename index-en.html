				<div> Sports, short for e-sports, is a form of video game competition. Athletes often take the form of organized multiplayer video game competitions, especially between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been part of the culture of video games, they mostly took place among amateurs until the late 2000s, when the participation of professional gamers and viewers in these events via live streaming experienced a great increase in popularity. Until the 2010s, esport was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events.
				<div> By the late 2010s, total sports audiences are estimated to grow to 454 million viewers, with revenue increasing to more than $ 1 billion, with China accounting for 35% of global sports revenue in 2020. The growing availability of online streaming media platforms, especially YouTube and Twitter, has become central to the growth and promotion of sports competitions. Despite the fact that viewership is around 85% of men and 15% of women, with the majority of spectators aged between 18 and 34, female players also played professionally. The popularity and recognition of sports first occurred in Asia, where significant growth was recorded in China and South Korea, with the latter having licensed professional players since 2000. Despite the large video game industry, exports in Japan are relatively underdeveloped, mostly attributed to its broad anti-gambling laws banning paid professional gaming tournaments. Outside of Asia, esports are also popular in Europe and America, with regional and international events taking place in those regions.
